Learning deep learning this time!

## Caeser encryption function prediction

## More deeper
Combined with two words (we know the number of combination is too large, we just want to test, if neural network could learn something unseen?

AB -> CD
CD -> EF

BC -> DE 


## TODO list
- [x] Caeser ciper and impliment deep learning model
- [ ] Watching videos and papers for logic programming
### To figure out logic programming in deep learning
